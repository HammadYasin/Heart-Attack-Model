# Advanced Analytics Use Cases Website

Welcome to the Advanced Analytics Use Cases website developed by the Data Science team at Ascend Solutions Limited. This open-source project showcases three predictive models: Heart Attack Prediction, Weather Type Prediction, and Diabetes Prediction. 

## Features

- **Heart Attack Prediction**: Predict the likelihood of a heart attack based on input parameters.
- **Weather Type Prediction**: Classify the weather into one of four conditions: Cloudy, Rainy, Snowy, and Sunny.
- **Diabetes Prediction**: Assess the probability of diabetes based on various input metrics.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Flask (APIs)

## Installation

### Frontend

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ML-Models.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```bash
    cd ML-Models
    ```
3. Install the necessary npm packages:
    ```bash
    npm install --force
    ```

### Backend

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
    ```bash
    cd ML-Models/backend
    ```
2. Install Python and Flask:
    ```bash
    pip install flask
    ```
3. Install additional Python dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas
    pip install numpy 
    pip install pickle
    ```
4. Update the Flask configuration to change the proxy to host locally on a different port if needed, as Flask and React cannot be hosted on the same port.


## Running the Application

1. **Start the Flask Backend**:
    ```bash
    python server.py
    ```
2. **Start the React Frontend**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
